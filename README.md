## Hi there 👋
I'm a **Data Engineer** and **Data Scientist** who thrives at the intersection of analytics, strategy, and innovation.  With a master's in **Applied Data Science from the University of Michigan** and a **Supply Chain MicroMasters from MIT**, I work on projects that turn raw data into real-world insights by bridging business and technology. I've built scalable data pipelines, Power BI dashboards, and ML models across a variety of industries including supply chain, utilities, insurance claims, legal, operations, and product strategy.

### ⚙️ What I Work On
- 🔗 Scalable data pipelines with **Databricks**, **Snowflake**, and **Palantir Foundry**
- ☁️ Cloud platforms: Azure (data storage, orchestration) and AWS (EC2, S3, SageMaker, Redshift)
- 📊 Dashboards and Analytics: **Power BI** and **Streamlit**
- 🧠 Applied **ML & Data Mining** for anomaly detection, classification, and analysis
- 🌐 Urban air mobility analytics:  flight networks, infrastructure, **geospatial analysis**, and market intelligence
- 🤖 LLMs & RAG: Build applications using LangChain, ChromaDB, and OpenAI API for domain-specific Q&A and content generation

### 📌 Select Projects
**🏡 Smarter Home Search (Realtor GPT) with LLMs & Vector Search**
- Built a real estate app that uses LLMs and ChromaDB to transform listings into personalized narratives based on buyer preferences. Combines semantic search with LangChain to deliver a smarter, more intuitive home search experience.

**❄️ Yelp & Weather ELT Pipeline with Snowflake**
- Developed an end-to-end ELT pipeline that integrates Yelp and weather data to analyze the impact of climate on local business reviews. Utilized AWS S3 for data staging, Snowflake for data warehousing, and applied dimensional data modeling to support analytics.

**🚇 Real-Time Transit Dashboard with Kafka Streaming**
- Developed a streaming pipeline using Apache Kafka and its ecosystem to simulate and monitor real-time train statuses using public data from the Chicago Transit Authority. Integrated data from REST Proxy, Kafka Connect, KSQL, and Faust to process and visualize transit and weather information dynamically.

**📦 AI-Powered Inventory Monitoring Using Computer Vision**
- Built a computer vision pipeline using a pre-trained ResNet50 model to demonstrate how computer vision can be used to automate inventory counting in warehouse bins.  Deployed the model via AWS SageMaker and Lambda to enable real-time object counting from test images.

**🚨 Disaster Response Message Classifier**
- Developed a machine learning pipeline to classify real-time disaster-related messages into multiple categories, aiding emergency response efforts. Integrated an ETL process, trained a multi-output classifier, and deployed a Flask web app for interactive message classification.
