## Hi there 👋
I'm a **Data Engineer** and **Data Scientist** who thrives at the intersection of analytics, strategy, and innovation.  With a master's in **Applied Data Science from the University of Michigan** and a **Supply Chain MicroMasters from MIT**, I work on projects that turn raw data into real-world insights by bridging business and technology. I've built scalable data pipelines, Power BI dashboards, and ML models across a variety of industries including supply chain, utilities, insurance claims, legal, operations, and product strategy.
